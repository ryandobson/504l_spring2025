### Question 1:

Create a histogram for the age variable. Describe the distribution.

```{r}
p1 <- df |> ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(
    color = "red", #this is for outline 
    fill = "lightblue"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Participant Age",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Histogram of Age",
    caption = ""
  ) +
  theme504()

```

### Question 2:

Create box plots for the math variable by public. Given that public schools are coded as 1 and non-public schools are coded as 0. Which type of school performs better in terms of students’ math performance? Why? Use the boxes in the box plot to justify your answers.

```{r}
p2 <- df |> ggplot(aes(y = math, color = publicF)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    y = "Math",
    color = "" #changing color to blank removes the legend title -- comment this out to see what happens
  )  +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_blank(), # Removes the x-axis tick labels -- not 
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank() # Removes the tick marks
  ) +
  theme504() #apply custom theme

```

### Question 3:

Calculate the mean, median, range, IQR, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis for the income variable. Provide a brief summary of the statistics to describe the income variable (don’t forget the unit of the variable while interpreting the results).

```{r}

describe(df$income) #gives most things
summary(df$income)  #for IQR 

var(df$income)  #for variance 

#Remember, variance is also the square root of the standard deviation 
sqrt(var(df$income)) 

```

### Question 4

Save graphs and tables from (1) and (2) (screenshot, export, or whatever means you prefer). And incorporate them into a Word document.

### Question 5

Incorporate your R syntax or SPSS syntax into the same Word document.
